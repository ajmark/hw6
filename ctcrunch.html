       <h3>About</h3>	
		   <p>Cinnamon Toast Crunch (previously called Cinnamon Grahams in the UK but now called Curiously Cinnamon), known as Croque-Cannelle in France and as a different-tasting but similar-looking variant called Cini Minis in other European countries where available, is a brand cereal produced by General Mills and Nestl√©. The cereal was first produced in 1984. Cinnamon Toast Crunch aims to provide the taste of cinnamon toast in a crunch cereal format. The cereal consists of small squares or rectangles of wheat and rice covered with cinnamon and sugar. Because of its rice content, when immersed in milk, one can hear "snap" sounds coming from it, similar to Rice Krispies. In most European countries the product is sold in boxes but in Poland the cereal is sold in bags. The product is currently marketed outside Europe with the mascot of a jolly baker named Chef Wendell.</p>
